}
\details{
For better results, you should write the complete movie title with its exact
spelling. Results are sorted by their similarity with the search terms.

If you don't find the movie you are looking for, you can visit the IMDb
website (\url{https://www.imdb.com}) and get this ID from the movie URL. It
is always in the form: tt9999999 (only numbers are specific to the movie; the
prefix 'tt' is a constant).

For instance, in this URL: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5699154/, the IMDb ID
is 'tt5699154'.

For non-english movies, the english name might be different from the original
title. For example, the english title of the french movie "Le Sens de la
fÃªte" (2017) is "C'est la vie!" (IMDb ID = tt5699154).

Only movies are currently implemented.
